### Thesis Abstract 
This paper uses a modified version of the Synthetic Control Method to evaluate the impact of the Consumption Decriminalization Law — which in 2001 decriminalized illicit substance use, acquisition, and possession in Portugal — on the incidence of HIV and AIDS among injecting drug users. The modified Synthetic Control Method requires individual control series, instead of only the Synthetic Control, to be on the same growth path as the target series to avoid mistaking in-sample overfitting for common trends. This mistake is possible because of the large number of potential controls relative to observations in the pre-intervention period.

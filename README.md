This repository contains a selection of projects I have worked on during university and internships:

## Bachelor Thesis
This folder contains the R script associated with my Bachelor thesis and the thesis itself:

### Thesis Abstract 
This paper uses a modified version of the Synthetic Control Method to evaluate the impact of the Consumption Decriminalization Law — which in 2001 decriminalized illicit substance use, acquisition, and possession in Portugal — on the incidence of HIV and AIDS among injecting drug users. The modified Synthetic Control Method requires individual control series, instead of only the Synthetic Control, to be on the same growth path as the target series to avoid mistaking in-sample overfitting for common trends. This mistake is possible because of the large number of potential controls relative to observations in the pre-intervention period. 

## Seminar Project 

This folder contains the R script associated with the seminar group project I conducted as part of my General Econometrics specialization for my Econometrics and operations Research Bachelor. The group consisted of 5 people. 

### Seminar Project Abstract 
This paper examines the interplay between the Spotify ‘Viral 50 - Global’ and ‘Top 50 - Global’ playlists, two daily playlists Spotify publishes containing the 50 most viral and 50 most streamed songs of the day, respectively. As Spotify also publishes Viral Global and Top Global charts containing the 100 most viral and 200 most streamed songs every day, this opens up the possibility of exploiting the discontinuity at the 50th rank in either playlist for an RD design. Concretely, we assess whether the inclusion of a song in one of two playlists improves the song’s probability of entering the other chart within 30 days and whether the inclusion of a song in one of two playlists improves the song’s best ranking on the other chart within 30 days. We explore the former question using linear, quadratic, linear probit, quadratic probit, local linear regression, and local randomization models. We approach the second question using a Tobit Type-I model, due to the right-censoring of ranks present in both charts. We do not find robustly significant treatment effects in either of our designs. One implication of these results is that the exposure of the Viral playlist - which is usually more easily penetrable for smaller artists - does not appear to lead to significant popularity gains for songs.

## Comparison_GARCH
This folder contains the multiple MATLAB files associated with a group project (research paper) on the relationship between returns and volatility. The study aims to determine whether returns lead or if a contemporaneous relationship exists by comparing different GARCH and RT-GARCH models and the VIX (benchmark). The analysis uses time series data on S&P 500 index returns, daily measures of the realized variance of the S&P 500 index based on intraday returns, and VIX to estimate the parameters of those models and calculate predicted volatility. Then, it contrasts those models through various in-sample and out-of-sample tests. 

## Demand_Estimation.py
The Python script scrapes data from the Google Play Store and performs a demand estimation analysis for the top 500 paid apps by employing logit and nested logit models. For the same apps, it also computes markups under different competitive structures. Besides, it performs a merger simulation analysis that aims to identify which app the developer the market leader should acquire. 

## Market_Correlation_Analysis.R
The R script conducts changes in market share correlation analysis to evaluate the competitive closeness between (potential) merging entities.

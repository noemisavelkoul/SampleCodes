This repository contains a selection of projects I have worked on during university and internships:

## Bachelor Thesis
This folder contains the R script associated with my Bachelor thesis and the thesis itself:

### Thesis Abstract 
This paper uses a modified version of the Synthetic Control Method to evaluate the impact of the Consumption Decriminalization Law — which in 2001 decriminalized illicit substance use, acquisition, and possession in Portugal — on the incidence of HIV and AIDS among injecting drug users. The modified Synthetic Control Method requires individual control series, instead of only the Synthetic Control, to be on the same growth path as the target series to avoid mistaking in-sample overfitting for common trends. This mistake is possible because of the large number of potential controls relative to observations in the pre-intervention period. 


## Comparison_GARCH
This folder contains the multiple MATLAB files associated with a group project (research paper) on volatility analysis. The study investigates the relationship between returns and volatility, aiming to determine whether returns lead or if a contemporaneous relationship exists by comparing different GARCH and RT-GARCH models and the VIX (benchmark). The analysis uses time-indexed data on S&P 500 index returns, daily measures of the realized variance of the S&P 500 index based on intraday returns, and VIX to estimate the parameters of those models and calculate predicted volatility. Then, it contrasts those models through various in-sample and out-of-sample tests. 

## Demand_Estimation.py
The Python script scrapes data from the Google Play Store and performs a demand estimation analysis for the top 500 paid apps by employing logit and nested logit models. For the same apps, it also computes markups under different competitive structures. Besides, it performs a merger simulation analysis that aims to identify which app the developer the market leader should acquire. 

## Market_Correlation_Analysis.R
The R script conducts changes in market share correlation analysis to evaluate the competitive closeness between (potential) merging entities.
